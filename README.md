Why:
This learning branch is dedicated to the hours of learning I have spent. Having a family, full time job, and wanting a career change requires some thought.
I choose to learn python to solve real world problems and help with developemtn of tools for national defense (well maybe someday :D).

Python is a journey that started when I realized that creating things in code is a lot more fun to me than phycially connecting things, or clicking through GUIs to get stuff done.

I am planning on gettings certified in PCEP Python Certified Entry-Level Programmer\
Then I want to contribute to projects and help others with documentation or code\
\
Once I get some experience under my belt I want to go after the PCAP Python Certified Associate-Level Programmer\
By the time I get my PCAP I should have a job as a software engineer.
